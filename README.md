# AUDIO-PROCESSING
This repository provides a streamlined workflow for audio analysis and transcription. It includes functionality to convert audio files in MP4 format to WAV format and then process the audio using Whisper AI and Hugging Face for transcription. The transcripts are segmented into smaller bits, checked for phrase fragments, and cleaned by removing unwanted segments. Additionally, the repository enables analysis and comparison between an original audio file and a fake audio file to identify discrepancies and insights.
